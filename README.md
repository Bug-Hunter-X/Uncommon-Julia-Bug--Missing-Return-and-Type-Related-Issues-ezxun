# Uncommon Julia Bug: Missing Return and Type-Related Issues

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Julia function that can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior depending on input types and missing return statements.

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.jl` provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description

The original function `my_function` has two main issues:

1. **Missing Return Statement**: If the input `x` is 0, the function doesn't have a return statement.  This leads to an `UndefVarError` when calling the function.
2. **Type-Related Behavior in Conditional Expression**: The conditional expression might produce unexpected results depending on the type of `x`. While it may appear to work correctly for integers, issues might arise when using floating-point numbers, leading to potential inaccuracies in the output.
